Ruby Koans
==========

My attempts at the Ruby Koans.

The Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture by basing the koans on tests. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. Testing is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in Ruby.

Please see http://rubykoans.com/ and https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans for the files.
